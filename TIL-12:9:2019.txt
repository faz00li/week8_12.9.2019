Running Programs
We run a program with the following two steps:

Compiling: In the project directory, run > dotnet build. FileName.cs should be the name of the file containing program code. This creates an .exe file.
Executing: After compiling, run the following to launch the .dll file: > dotnet run


*****GIT*****
$ git log --oneline
This will list all of our local Git commits. Locate the number of the commit to revert back to and save it.

Then, run the following command, providing the specific commit number:

$ git reset <commit-number>
For example, if a commit had the identifier 56e05fced, we would revert back to that point in time with the following command:

$ git reset 56e05fced
